# 📖 Vachanapetty

**Vachanapetty (വചനപ്പെട്ടി)** is a simple and meaningful Malayalam Christian app that brings you daily Bible verses in a beautifully designed and easy-to-use interface.  
The name *Vachanapetty* literally means "Verse Box" – just like the traditional verse promise boxes used in homes and churches, this app gives you a new verse to read, meditate, and share every day.
